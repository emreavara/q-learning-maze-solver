# q-learning-maze-solver
Q Learning Reinforcement learning algorithm is implemented to design an agent that can solve a given maze.

In this code Q Learning Reinforcement learning algorithm is implemented to design an agent that can solve a given maze.
To run the code, map information with the proper syntax : 

map_information = { cell_tuple: “Wall”, cell_tuple:”Wall”, .. “information”: {“rows”:x,  “columns”: y, “start”:cell_tuple, “end”: cell_tuple} }

must be given. It finds the shortest possible path from the start to the end.
